            Hi! I’m an enthusiastic and detail-oriented aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. I recently completed a comprehensive Data Analytics course where I learned how to clean, analyze, and visualize data to support smart decision-making.
            I’ve worked on real-world projects that allowed me to explore customer behavior, business trends, and operational performance. I enjoy finding patterns, solving problems, and transforming raw data into clear and impactful dashboards and reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach combines technical proficiency with strategic thinking, ensuring 
            that data-driven recommendations align with business objectives and deliver 
            measurable results.
